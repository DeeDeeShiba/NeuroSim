Agent-based MATLAB simulation that simulates lab mice behavior using machine learning models

Simulate and study the behavior of lab mice in a controlled environment using an agent-based model in MATLAB. Users can define parameters such as birth rate, total mice count, aggression levels, and food availability at the start of the simulation. The project combines rule-based systems and machine learning algorithms to create a dynamic and realistic representation of mice interactions. The goal is to provide researchers with a tool to ethically explore diverse scenarios, reducing harm to lab animals while maximizing results.
